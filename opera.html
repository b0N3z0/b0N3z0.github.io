          <span class="album-quote"><i>"Bohemian Rhapsody was totally insane, we never stopped laughing. It was basically a joke, but a successful joke”</i> <br>Roy Thomas Baker - Producer</span>
          </p>
          <p>Queen's fourth and probably best known album, was recorded in England between August and November 1975. Such was the complexity of the compositions that no less than six different studios were employed, with the band members often recording various parts simultaneously in order to work most efficiently and get through it all. The sessions were long and gruelling and spanned four long months. Once again the band produced the album with trusted collaborators, Roy Thomas Baker and Mike Stone, and what emerged was a genuine triumph on all levels, meticulously pieced together to make the best possible album. <i >A Night At The Opera</i> would propel Queen on to the world stage on a mammoth scale and establish them as a major international force. Though it was never in any doubt within the band, it proved that <i>Seven Seas Of Rhye</i> and <i>Killer Queen</i> were not fleeting hits from another glam-type British wannabe band; Queen were here to stay and <i >Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and<i>A Night At The Opera</i> would confirm it for those in any doubt</p>
          <p>It is a matter of public record that a very great deal hinged upon the success or failure of this album. Had it failed, it is entirely feasible the band would not have survived and Queen may well have ended there and then. Despite having two top ten albums under their belt, and significant international hits with <i >Seven Seas</i> and <i >Killer Queen</i>, and sell-out shows all around Britain, the band was in serious financial difficulty by the start of 1975. Recording and relentless touring for three solid years had still not yielded anything like what the band were due, and, to add insult to injury, Roger, John, Brian and Freddie were still struggling to get by on the minimal wage from Trident, to whom they were signed. Enter the story at this point, Jim Beach, the lawyer who would eventually negotiate Queen's release from Trident's grasp and from the deal that had so far afforded such little reward for the band. It would be some years before the band formerly parted company with Trident. Eventually Queen were extricated from their deal and left to make <i class="album_title">A Night At The Opera</i> without distraction or financial pressure. So, with a clean slate and blank canvas on which to create, the much relieved Queen, along with stalwarts Roy Thomas Baker and Mike Stone, committed the next quarter of a year to the meticulous and all-consuming craft of honing the album that Brian would later refer to as ‘Queen's Sgt Peppers’.</p>
          <p>The album cover was given a simple but lavish treatment, with Freddie's original crest design updated and coloured and placed centre of the album cover. The LP gatefold complimented the style, with the lyrics printed over two sides of the inside cover, and for the first time the inner sleeve was in colour and featured live photos from Queen’s most recent tour.</p>
          <p><i >A Night At The Opera </i>is a wonderfully rich and diverse gathering of carefully constructed and, some might say, unlikely compositions from all four band members. Every track is strong and every moment from beginning to end is beautifully recorded. The late lamented Mike Stone (engineer), who sadly passed away in 2002, once again played an integral part in achieving the sound of this album. <i >Opera</i> spans all kinds of musical styles and genres and veers off at tangents as unlikely the album title itself.</p>
          <p>Aside from the well known material, also on this album is to be found Freddie's exquisite <i >Love Of My Life</i>, rumoured to have been inspired by his long time girlfriend of the time Mary Austin.</p>
          <p><i >A Night At The Opera</i> was finally finished in early November of 1975 and released to worldwide critical acclaim later that month on the 21st. It very quickly became Queen's first No 1 album, and also their first to achieve Platinum sales status. It went top 5 in the USA and achieved Gold status there, helped in no small part by extensive tours of North America and Canada earlier in the year.</p>
